# Customer Segmentation Classification

In this project, we analyze customer segmentation to identify distinct customer groups based on key metrics like age, gender, monthly expenses, loyalty, spending score, and region. The goal is to classify customers into well-defined segments, providing data-driven insights for targeted marketing and strategic business decisions.



## Project Structure

- **`Customer Segmentation Classification.xlsx`**: Dataset containing customer information with relevant variables for segmentation analysis.
- **`CUSTOMER_TABLEAU_.twbx`**: Tableau workbook showcasing visualizations and interconnected stories derived from the customer segmentation analysis.



## Objective

This project aims to classify customers into segments, enabling businesses to identify and manage differentiated customer groups. By observing demographic and behavioral metrics, we offer a data-driven perspective on customer relationship management.



## Key Variables

- **Age**: Provides a demographic breakdown of customers by age.
- **Gender**: Displays the gender distribution among customers.
- **Monthly Expenses**: Monthly spending data, useful for analyzing purchasing capacity.
- **Loyalty**: Loyalty score categorized as low, moderate, or high.
- **Spending Score**: Reflects customer engagement and purchasing frequency.
- **Region**: Customer's geographical location to observe regional trends.
- **Timestamp**: Tracks transaction time to identify patterns over time.



## Visualizations and Analytics

The Tableau workbook includes various visualizations and analyses, such as:

1. **Customer Distribution**: An overview of customer demographics and spending habits.
2. **Bump Chart**: Highlights trends in customer spending and loyalty changes.
3. **Pareto Chart**: Applies the 80/20 principle to cumulative spending or other metrics, identifying high-value customers.
4. **Interconnected Stories**: Various customer stories in Tableau illustrate insights across segments, highlighting the relationship between customer attributes and spending behavior.



## Future Scope

Further analysis could incorporate machine learning models for customer classification and predictive insights. Adding customer satisfaction scores and other attributes would enhance segmentation quality, allowing for a more refined customer management strategy.
