# Customer-Segmentation-Classification
In this project, customer segmentation is analyzed to understand various customer groups based on key metrics like age, gender, monthly expenses, loyalty, spending score, and region. All in all, the goal is to classify customers into distinct segments and, thereby, have data-driven insight for targeted marketing and business strategy.

Project Structure
Customer Segmentation Classification.xlsx - a dataset containing information about the customers with variables relevant to the segmentation analysis.
CUSTOMER_TABLEAU_.twbx: A Tableau workbook showing the visualizations and interlinked stories about the findings of customer segmentation.

Objective
This project is meant to classify customers into segments so that businesses can find differentiated groups in their customers. By the observations made across metrics of demographics and behavior, this project is designed to be able to offer a data-driven perspective for managing customer relationships.
 
Key Variables
Age: Customers' age for a proper understanding of the demographic spread.
Gender: The spread of gender among customers.
Monthly Expenses: Monthly spends recorded for the purpose of studying the purchasing capacity.
Loyalty: Percentage of loyalty score, it is either low, moderate, or high.
Spending Score: Measures how much the customer is engaged or consumes.
Region: Geographical location of customer to see regional trends
Timestamp: Time for when a transaction occurred to see the trend over time

Visualizations and Analytics
The following visualizations and analysis tools that are applied in the Tableau workbook are:
Customer Distribution This contains an overview of customers according to demographics and spending habits.
Bump Chart: this one is used to present the trend in changing spending or loyalty for different customers.
Pareto Chart: Cumulative Spending or other metrics in an attempt to apply the 80/20 principle to identify high-value customers
Interconnected Stories: Various customer stories created in Tableau to illustrate insights across the segments and then focus on how attributes are related to spending.

Future Scope
The customer classification can be further supported by developing machine learning models in order to classify and predict the customers. Scores for customer satisfaction can be added along with others to make the quality of segmentation more perfect.
